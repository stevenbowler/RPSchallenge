# RPSchallenge

### Overview
This is an execution of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, that has afforded this developer opportunity to develop knowledge in development of real-time game, as well as use of [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) realtime database for managing multi-user game state in the cloud.


### User Documentation

Alternatively, in multi-user mode, another player can load the game, register and stand-by for the other user to click play to signal ready to play.
