The main challenge on this project was managing the multi-player interactive game environment thru Firebase in the cloud.

The game offers two modes of operation: Solitaire and Multiplayer.

Solitaire of course allows the user to play against the computer, which selects Rock, Paper, Scissors on a random basis.

Multi-user mode is made available to the solitaire game player once two players are online.

All of the code is documented in JS Docs.
